/// A wasi-keyvalue like interface with time-to-live (TTL) support for automatic expiration.
///
/// This interface provides key-value operations with TTL capabilities,
/// allowing entries to automatically expire after a specified duration.
///
/// Each of these operations acts on a single key-value pair.
///
/// The value in the key-value pair is defined as a `u8` byte array and the intention is that it is
/// the common denominator for all data types defined by different key-value stores to handle data,
/// ensuring compatibility between different key-value stores. Note: the clients will be expecting
/// serialization/deserialization overhead to be handled by the key-value store. The value could be
/// a serialized object from JSON, HTML or vendor-specific data types.
///
/// ## Persistence and Expiration
///
/// Store entries MAY be persisted across application restarts depending on the implementation.
/// Entries are automatically removed from the bucket when:
/// * Their time-to-live (TTL) expires
/// * They are explicitly deleted
///
/// Some implementations MAY enforce storage limits. When a limit is reached,
/// new `set` operations will fail with `error::storage-limit-exceeded`. When this
/// occurs, extensions must explicitly delete entries to free space before adding new ones.
///
/// ## Consistency
///
/// Data consistency in a key-value store refers to the guarantee that once a write operation
/// completes, all subsequent read operations will return the value that was written.
///
/// Any implementation of this interface must have enough consistency to guarantee "reading your
/// writes." In particular, this means that the client should never get a value that is older than
/// the one it wrote, but it MAY get a newer value if one was written around the same time. These
/// guarantees only apply to the same client (which will likely be provided by the host or an
/// external capability of some kind). In this context a "client" is referring to the caller or
/// guest that is consuming this interface. Once a write request is committed by a specific client,
/// all subsequent read requests by the same client will reflect that write or any subsequent
/// writes. Another client running in a different context may or may not immediately see the result
/// due to replication lag. As an example of all of this, if a value at a given key is A, and
/// the client writes B, then immediately reads, it should get B. If something else writes C in
/// quick succession, then the client may get C. However, a client running in a separate context may
/// still see A or B.
